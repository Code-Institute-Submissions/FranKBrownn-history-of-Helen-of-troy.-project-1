                        <h2>The myth of Helen of Troy</h2>
                        <p>From the world of Greek mythology, Helen of Troy was know to be the most beautiful girl of all the lands. She was known the live around 1200bc. According
                            to the myth Helen is the daugter of Zeus the father and protector of all gods and Nemesis the goddess of retribution and vengeance. However it is also known    
                            that she born into King Tyndareus and Queen Leda of Sparta. Whichever story is true. Shortly after her birth came the long war known as
                            the "Trojan War" where many men and armies were fighting for Helen and for her beauty and love.

                                    The Trojan war started when one man named Paris ,the Prince of Troy ran away with Helen who was currenlty married to Menelaus, the Sparten King.
                                    Paris taking Helen all the way back to Troy was the spark to start a long and bloody war lasting 10 years. It encouraged many men from many factions to 
                                    fight for Helen. The war covered all of modern day Greece spanning all the way across the north sea, to the west coast of modern day north 
                                    Turkey, where the ancient city of Troy was built. Once Helen was taken back to Troy, Menelaus asked his brother, Agamemnon, to lead a navel expedition
                                    across the sea to the city of Troy to bring her back, giving Helen a new title "The Face that Launched 1000 Ships". After the war, it didn't end there,    
                                    Helen of Troy was continually fought over and married by many man in the years to come.
