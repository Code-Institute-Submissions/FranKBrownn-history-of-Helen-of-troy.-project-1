            <h2>Theseus and the abduction</h2>

            <p>
                when Theseus was coming of age he was set out to find a wife for himself. he set his eyes apon Helen of Tory, Although very young at the time Theaseus saw 
                Helen as very beautiful and was set to marry her when she is of age. istead of waiting for the opotunity Theasus decided to go to sparter, when Helen was around 
                the age of 9 to 11, and abduct her. theseus then brought her to his mother, in a small city outside of Athens, he his mother to raise her up until she is of
                age to marry. This was short lived however. shortly after her abduction Helen's brothers Castor and Pollux rescued Helen while, accouding to the myth, Theseus
                was sent to the underworld. Helen was then returned to sparta where she lived the rest her childhood.

            <h3>Deiphobus the opportunist brother</h3>
                    
            <p>During the war of trojan paris's brother Deiphobus was fighting by his side Deiphobus was alot braver then his brother and apeared more heroic to the side of Troy  
                and due to paris's inexperience on the battlefeild paris was killed in combat. The council of troy was ready to end the war and was willing to give Helen back to Menelaus
                to end the fighting. But the beauty of Helen stole the heart of yet another man, Deiphobus, who ended up marrying Helen shorty after the death of his brother. the council
                didnt like this and they no longer saw Deiphobus as the hero he once was. Deiphobus was wed to Helen right up to the fall of Troy where Deiphobus was killed and Helen  
                was retuned to Menlaus. endeding the 10 year war.
