### testing

. I have tested all of the nav tools and the link the user correctly the the right page. 

. My form has working requirement eliments making the user put in the correct information before the submit button can work as intended. 

. the respsivnes of the page works to a degree the words and images do adjust when changing the size of the browers but it dosen't look as smooth as i would like on smaller   devices 

### unfixed bugs

. The copy right logo at the bottom right has a weird A symbol that i cant seem to get rid off.

. I would have liked within the form element form the 2 name boxes to have been next to each other but when doing the the email box always became very large and i couldn't find a way to fix it so i setled with them being underneath each other.
